/**
 * Ordered steps for the value walk. Each step optionally navigates to a route
 * and anchors a coachmark to an element marked `data-tour="<anchor>"`. Anchoring
 * the sidebar nav links keeps anchors stable across route changes; steps without
 * an anchor render as a centered card.
 *
 * The tour is context-aware: when the workspace has sample data we walk into a
 * real chart and a real bill instead of pointing at empty tabs, and the finale
 * is the AI helper answering a real question. Voice: simple, fourth-grade,
 * warm, no em dashes. Lead with the value: you own your data and real AI tools
 * are built in.
