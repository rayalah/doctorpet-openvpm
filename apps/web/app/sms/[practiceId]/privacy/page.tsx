      <p>
        The clinic may use your name, mobile number, pet and appointment
        details, message content, consent record, and opt-out status to send

      <h2>No sale or promotional sharing</h2>
      <p>
        The clinic and {platformBrand.productName} do not sell your personal information. SMS opt-in

        marketing or promotional purposes.

      <p>
        Information may be processed by {platformBrand.productName}&apos;s infrastructure providers,

        obligations.
      </p>

      <h2>Retention and security</h2>
      <p>
        Consent, message, and opt-out records are retained as part of the
        clinic&apos;s business and medical-record systems for as long as needed
        to provide the service and meet legal or operational requirements.
        {platformBrand.productName} uses encryption in transit, role-based access, and tenant
        isolation to protect hosted records.
      </p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <p>
        Reply STOP to stop text messages or HELP for help. You may also contact
        the clinic to ask about its records or update your communication
        preferences. An opt-out applies to text messages; the clinic may still
        contact you through other channels when appropriate.
