        Your team just took {brand.name} through a real clinic workflow—not a demo or
        a setup checklist. That&apos;s a meaningful first win.

          Keep validating the workflow with your team. A card is not required
          during this supported trial.
        </Paragraph>
      </InfoCard>

      <Paragraph>
        When the clinic is ready, add billing once and the workspace can keep
        moving without an interruption at the end of the trial.
