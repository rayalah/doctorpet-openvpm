        Hi {practiceName}, we couldn&apos;t process your latest {brand.name} payment
        of <strong>{amount}</strong>. This usually means a card expired or was
        replaced — it&apos;s a quick fix.

        Your data is safe. If a payment ultimately doesn&apos;t clear, your
        workspace becomes read-only — nothing is deleted, and reactivating takes
        one click. Need a hand? Just reply to this email.
